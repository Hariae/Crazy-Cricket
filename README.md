Strategy Based Cricket game.
This is my first Publicly shared code.
The code is a back end for a strategy based cricket game .
I am in the development process and I am adding new features slowly.
So far I have just designed new batsmen change after a wicket and a bowler change every over.
I have also made sure a bowler bowls only 4 overs.
The file gets inputs from a seperate file,which is the skill set of the player.
Based on the skill set the runs and wickets are generated based on probability.
